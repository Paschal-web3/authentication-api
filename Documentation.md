## Overview
The **User Authentication API** provides basic features like:
- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing details like full name, age, address, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Users can log in with their email and password, receiving a JWT for further authentication.
- **User Management**: Includes operations to retrieve, update, and delete users from the system.

The API uses MongoDB as a database to store user information, bcrypt for hashing passwords, and JWT for issuing authentication tokens.

---

## Authentication Flow

1. **Register**: User registers by providing all required fields (name, email, password, etc.). The password is hashed using bcrypt before being saved.
2. **Login**: The user logs in using the registered email and password. Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued.
3. **Token Verification**: The issued JWT token is sent in headers (Authorization: Bearer `token`) for subsequent requests to verify the user's identity.

        "user": { ... },
        "accesToken": "your-jwt-token"
    }
    ```

- **Error Response**:
    - Missing required fields:

    ```json
    {
        "message": "User already exists with this email"
    }
    ```

        "Password": "password123"
    }
    ```
- **Success Response**:
    - Status: `200 OK`
    - Body:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "Login Successful",
        "user": { ... },
        "loginToken": "your-jwt-token"
    }
    ```

- **Error Response**:
    - User not found:
    ```json
    {
        "message": "User not found"
    }
    ```
    - Invalid password:
    ```json

- **Success Response**:
    - Status: `200 OK`
    - Body:
    ```json
    {
        "user": [ ... ]
    }
    ```

---

### GET /users/:id
Fetches a user by ID.

- **URL**: `/users/:id`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Success Response**:
    - Status: `200 OK`
    - Body:
    ```json
    {
        "_id": "user-id",
        "Fullname": "John Doe",
        ...
    }
    ```

- **Error Response**:

    ```json
    {
        "message": "User not found"
    }
    ```

---

### PUT /users/:id

    ```json
    {
        "message": "User updated",
        "response": { ... }
    }
    ```

    ```json
    {
        "message": "User not found"

    ```json
    {
        "message": "User not found"
    }
    ```

---

## Error Handling
All errors related to missing fields or invalid data are returned with descriptive messages and appropriate status codes:
- `400 Bad Request`: For missing or invalid data.
- `404 Not Found`: For resources that do not exist (e.g., user not found).
- `500 Internal Server Error`: For any server-side issues.

---

## Authentication with JWT
- After login or registration, a JWT token is issued to the client. The token contains a payload with user data (`userId`, `Fullname`), and it expires in 1 hour.
- The client is expected to send the JWT token in the `Authorization` header for any request that requires authentication:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
    ```

---

## Database Models

### User Schema
The user schema defines the structure of the user documents in the MongoDB database.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    Fullname: { type: String, required: true },
    Age: { type: Number, required: true },
    Address: { type: String, required: true },
    Email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    Password: { type: String, required: true }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

---

## Security Considerations
1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` before being stored in the database, ensuring they are not stored in plain text.
2. **JWT Expiration**: Tokens expire after 1 hour, reducing the risk of unauthorized long-term access.
3. **Sensitive Data**: API secrets (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`) and database connection strings are stored securely in environment variables.
